I must admit that the travelling bug that has bit so many people all over the world has not really bit me. I'm not really a travel person though I do like to travel to a new place to take my mind off things, to break a routine. 

I travelled to Doha, Qatar because my uncle lived there. Didn't really know what to expect from the place. Got the visa in a couple of days, booked the tickets and I was sitting on my Economy seat soon enough. 

The thing I'll remember Doha most for are the lights. As the sun set, the whole city was lit up marvelously. Even though I knew mentally that Doha was built in the middle of a desert, the beautiful lightings across the city made it seem like the vast desert dissappeared once the sun set. 

There were just tall skyscrapers, beautiful roads and malls - all lining the coast of the Arabian gulf (/Persian gulf).

Everyone spoke English. Never really had a problem with the language. Felt more like home actually. A lot of people speaking Malayalam, some speaking Telugu and Tamil, lots of them speaking Hindi. 

The Corniche (promenade along the Arabian gulf) has been constructed with great care. It's great to just take a long walk with cafés and restaurants lining the walk way.
