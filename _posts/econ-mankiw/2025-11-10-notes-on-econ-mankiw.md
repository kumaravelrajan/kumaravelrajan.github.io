    10. Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off between Inflation and Unemployment

# Chapter 2: Thinking like an economist

1. Appendix : Graphing review

    - Slope: $$\Delta y / \Delta x$$
    - Slope for straight line same everywhere. This does not apply for other curves.
    - Slope is positive for upward facing curve, negative for downward facing curve and zero for horizontal line.
    - Shifting of curve v/s moving along a curve: 

        When dealing with a coordinate system with two variables on the axes and we are focusing on a third unmentioned variable, the graph shifts to the left or right.

        While focusing on variables mentioned in the axes, we move along a curve.

    - Common pitfalls in graphs

        - Correlation is not causation - Possessing cigarette lighters might be correlated to increased cancer cases but it is smoking that causes this, not owning lighters. 

        - Reverse causation - Higher number of police might be correlated to higher number of crimes but this does not mean that the police is the cause for crimes. Instead, it more generally might be the case that it is the crime that necessitates hiring more police.

1. Comparative advantage: The driving force of specialization

    1. Absolute advantage: 
    
        The ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer. Here, Ruby needs fewer input (time) to produce both meat and potatoes. Hence, Ruby has absolute advantage in producing both meat and potatoes. 

    1. Comparative advantage: 

        |                     | Opportunity Cost of 1 oz Meat | Opportunity Cost of 1 oz Potatoes |
        |---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
        | Frank the farmer    | 4 oz potatoes                 | 1/4 oz meat                       |
        | Ruby the rancher    | 2 oz potatoes                 | 1/2 oz meat                       |

        - Defintion of comparative advantage: 
        
            The producer who gives up less of other goods to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is said to have a comparative advantage in producing it.

        In our example, Frank has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than Ruby: An ounce of potatoes costs Frank only ¼ ounce of meat, but it costs Ruby ½ ounce of meat. Conversely, Ruby has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than Frank: An ounce of meat costs Ruby 2 ounces of potatoes, but it costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes. 
        
        Thus, Frank has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and Ruby has a comparative advantage in producing meat.
