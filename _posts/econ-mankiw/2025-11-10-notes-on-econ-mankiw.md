# Chapter 2: Thinking like an economist

1. Appendix : Graphing review

    - Slope: $$\Delta y / \Delta x$$
    - Slope for straight line same everywhere. This does not apply for other curves.
    - Slope is positive for upward facing curve, negative for downward facing curve and zero for horizontal line.
    - Shifting of curve v/s moving along a curve: 

        When dealing with a coordinate system with two variables on the axes and we are focusing on a third unmentioned variable, the graph shifts to the left or right.

        While focusing on variables mentioned in the axes, we move along a curve.

    - Common pitfalls in graphs

        - Correlation is not causation - Possessing cigarette lighters might be correlated to increased cancer cases but it is smoking that causes this, not owning lighters. 

        - Reverse causation - Higher number of police might be correlated to higher number of crimes but this does not mean that the police is the cause for crimes. Instead, it more generally might be the case that it is the crime that necessitates hiring more police.
