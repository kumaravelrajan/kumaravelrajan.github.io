        1. Computer Forensics

## Module 2: The evolution of cybersecurity

1. Past cybersecurity attacks

    1. Malware and Viruses

        1. Malware
        
            Malware (short for malicious software) is a broad category of any software deliberately designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

        1. Virus

            Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. <ins>Computer virus is a specific type of malware</ins> that attaches itself to other programs or files and replicates in order to spread.

    1. CERT (Computer Emergency Response Teams) and CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Teams)

1. Attacks in the digital age

    1. Social engineering

        A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables. 

    1. Phishing

        The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

    1. PII and SPII

        1. PII (Personally identifiable information)

            Data like Names, Date of births, Emails etc. In short, any data that can be used to identify a person. 

        1. SPII (Sensitive personally identifiable information)

            Data like bank accounts, credit card numbers, biometric data etc. 

1. Common attacks and their effectiveness

    1. Malware (Malicious software)

        Commong types of malware attacks include: 

        1. Viruses:

            Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

        1. Worms:

            Self replicating malware that duplicates itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user.

        1. Ransomeware:

            Encrypts organization data and demands payment to restore access. 

        1. Spyware

    1. Social engineering

        A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain unauthorized access to sensitive, private, and/or valuable data.

        1. Phishing

            Some common types of phishing attack are: 

            1. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

            1. Spear phishing: 
            
                A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

                1. Whaling:

                    Form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data. 

            1. Vishing: Voice phishing

            1. Smishing: Sms phishing. 

            1. Social media phishing:

                Threat actor collects data from social media and then initiates attack.

        1. Watering hole attack:

            Threat actor attacks a website frequented by specific group of users. 

        1. USB baiting:

            Threat actor leaves around an unattended USB for someone to find it and plug in to their systems. The victim's system (and the network) gets infected with virus. 

        1. Physical social engineering:

            A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
        
1. Introduction to the eight CISSP security domains, Part 1

    CISSP divides the tasks a security professional does into 8 domains. They sometimes might overlap but in general, these 8 categories refer to 8 career paths. 

    1. Security and risk management

        - Set policies
        - Compliance

    1. Asset security

        - Protecting digital and physical assets. 
        - Old equipment properly disposed off. 

    1. Security architecture and engineering

        - Ensure data security by using effective tools and systems. 

        - Eg: Configuring firewalls

    1. Communication and network security

        - Secure physical networks and wireless communications.

1. Introduction to the eight CISSP security domains, Part 2

    1. Identity and access management

        - Ensuring authorized user access.

        - eg: Setting up employee key card access

    1. Security assessment and testing

        - Conducting security audits.

        - eg: Audits of user permissions.
