# Part I: Prices and markets

## Notes

1. Law of supply and law of demand

    - Law of supply: The quantity supplied varies directly with the price. 

    - Law of demand: The quantity demanded varies inversely with the price. 

    - In other words, people tend to buy more at lower prices and less at higher prices. Producers tend to supply more at higher prices and less and lower prices. 

1. Shortage v/s surplus

    - Shortage: Prices rise because the amount demanded exceeds the amount supplied <ins>*at existing prices*</ins>. 

    - Surplus: Prices fall because the amount supplied exceeds the amount demanded <ins>*at existing prices*</ins>. 

1. Scarcity and competition

    Quoting directly from the book - 

    Scarcity means that everyone’s desires cannot be satisfied completely, regardless of which particular economic system or government policy we choose—and regardless of whether an individual or a society is poor or prosperous, wise or foolish, noble or ignoble. 

1. Is having an economy optional?

    **Competition among people for scarce resources is inherent. It is not a question whether we like or dislike competition. Scarcity means that we do not have the option to choose whether or not to have an economy in which people compete.** 

    That is the only kind of economy that is possible—and our only choice is among the particular methods that can be used for that competition (free-market economy, communist economy and so forth).

# Part II: Industry and commerce

## Chapter 5: The rise and fall of businesses

1. Individual businesses v/s economy as a whole

    From the standpoint of an economy it does not matter whether specific companies make a profit or loss. Instead, all these rules help the most efficient allocation of scarce resources. 

1. Free market economies democratize power

    Free market economies give much more power to knowledge and insights even if people in power do not share those insights. This enables much more efficient allocation of scarce resources. This obviously does not happen in economies where political leaders control economic decision. In such systems, the political leaders need to be convinced about the new knowledge. In free market economy, if the insight is novel and useful enough, people with gravitate towards this new product/busines and hence there exists an evidence based method of determining which way to doing business is more valuable. 

## Chapter 6: The role of profits and losses

1. Visible cost in capitalism (profits) v/s invisible cost in socialism (inefficiency)

    Capitalism has a visible cost - profits - that socialism does not. But socialism has an invisible cost -  inefficiency. Inefficiency is weeded out from capitalistic economies through the concept of losses and bankruptcy. The fact that most goods are more widely affordable in a capitalist economy implies that profit is less costly than inefficiency. Put differently, profit is a price paid for efficiency. Clearly the greater efficiency must outweigh the profit or else socialism would in fact have had the more affordable prices and greater prosperity that its theorists expected, but which failed to materialize in the real world.

    If in fact the cost of profits exceeded the value of the efficiency they promote, then non-profit organizations or government agencies could get the same work done cheaper or better than profit-making enterprises, and could therefore displace them in the competition of the marketplace. Yet that seldom, if ever, happens, while the opposite happens increasingly—that is, private profit-making companies taking over various functions formerly performed by government agencies or by non-profit organizations such as colleges and universities.

1. Profit on sales & profit on investment

    1. Profit on sales

        If a store buys widgets for $10 each and sells them for $15 each, some might say that it makes $5 in profits on each widget that it sells.

    1. Net profit on sales

        Profit per sale leftover after all the costs are paid for - raw materials, salaries etc.

    1. Profit on investment (ROI)

        This is the most important metric for investors. It is nothing but ROI. 

    1. Profit on sales v/s profit on investment

        Things may be sold at prices that are much higher than what the seller paid for them and yet, if those items sit on a shelf in the store for months before being sold, the profit on investment may be less than with other items that have less of a mark-up in price but which sell out within a week.

        Profits on sales and profits on investment are not merely different concepts. They can move in opposite directions. One of the keys to the rise to dominance of the A & P grocery chain in the 1920s was a conscious decision by the company management to cut profit margins on sales, in order to increase the profit rate on investment. With the new and lower prices made possible by selling with lower profits per item, A & P was able to attract greatly increased numbers of customers, making far more total profit because of the increased volume of sales. Making a profit of only a few cents on the dollar on sales, but with the inventory turning over nearly 30 times a year, A & P’s profit rate on investment soared.

1. Costs of production

    1. Economies of scale

        Lower costs per unit of output as the number of units increases is what economists call “economies of scale.”
    
    1. Diseconomies of scale

        There comes a point, in every business, beyond which the cost of producing a unit of output no longer declines as the amount of production increases. In fact, costs per unit actually rise after an enterprise becomes so huge that it is difficult to monitor and coordinate, when the right hand may not always know what the left hand is doing.

    1. Costs and capacity
