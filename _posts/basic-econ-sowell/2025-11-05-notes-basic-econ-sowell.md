# Part I: Prices and markets

## Notes

1. Law of supply and law of demand

    - Law of supply: The quantity supplied varies directly with the price. 

    - Law of demand: The quantity demanded varies inversely with the price. 

    - In other words, people tend to buy more at lower prices and less at higher prices. Producers tend to supply more at higher prices and less and lower prices. 

1. Shortage v/s surplus

    - Shortage: Prices rise because the amount demanded exceeds the amount supplied <ins>*at existing prices*</ins>. 

    - Surplus: Prices fall because the amount supplied exceeds the amount demanded <ins>*at existing prices*</ins>. 

1. Scarcity and competition

    Quoting directly from the book - 

    Scarcity means that everyone’s desires cannot be satisfied completely, regardless of which particular economic system or government policy we choose—and regardless of whether an individual or a society is poor or prosperous, wise or foolish, noble or ignoble. 

1. Is having an economy optional?

    **Competition among people for scarce resources is inherent. It is not a question whether we like or dislike competition. Scarcity means that we do not have the option to choose whether or not to have an economy in which people compete.** 

    That is the only kind of economy that is possible—and our only choice is among the particular methods that can be used for that competition (free-market economy, communist economy and so forth).
