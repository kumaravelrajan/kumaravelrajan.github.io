München, like any other major city in the world has a housing market crisis. Demand is too much and the supply is perennially low. Add to that being an Indian who cannot speak fluent German, the options one has for housing really narrow down very quickly leading to desperation. 

In March 2024 I was frantically searching for a room to rent. I had to shift out from my subsidized student dorm by the end of the month. The pressure of having to finish my Masters thesis by the end of March did not help things as well. To say that I was desperate to find a room to rent would be an understatement. 

It was in this scenario that out of the hundreds of messages I had sent to landlords, a certain Mr. Roland Lux from Hoheneckstr. 53, München - 81243 messaged me back. 

## Initial meeting

The initial meeting itself was quite weird but I had already made up my mind to okay the room. I did get a weird sense but I disregarded it. He seemed okay but it did seem strange to me that he said if he faced any problems with me he would not hesitate to call the police. This threw me off. Why would someone mention calling the police in the first meeting itself? The fear of being homeless however pushed me to accept the rent. 

## Moving in and the start of troubles
